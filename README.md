## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## I am an Apple-NACME AI/ML Intensive bootcamp participant!

I recently graduated from FIU with a B.S. Mechanical Engineering

ðŸ¤”I am working on assignments to get familiar with python and swift for software engineering and machine learning. I will also use this github to work through OSSU before pursuing an M.S. Computer Science

ðŸ˜„ My favorite hobby is virtual reality on my Oculus Quest headset. It helps me stay connected with friends and my girlfriend when I travel for activities such as the aforementioned bootcamp
